# Contains

Containers deep dive

### Summary
A slim and practical approach to test and understand how containers works under the hood.

### Description
What containers are and are not. Why should we use containers and how does that affect the way that we develop our applications? We're going to answer that by creating a container from scratch, no Docker, LXC or Podman, only Linux and a lot of faith.

### Requirements
Basic notions of what a container is, if you run a container before it will be easier to associate the processes to your previous experience.
